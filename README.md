# Minions vs Zombies

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Matthias4/gba-sprite-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine)

## Introduction

This game was created for the lessons [Softwaredesign C/C++ & Qt](https://uhintra03.uhasselt.be/studiegidswww/opleidingsonderdeel.aspx?a=2018&i=3433&n=4&t=01).
The goal was to create a game to show the different programming skills which have been learned during the course of this subject.

The base of this project was the gba-sprite-engine of mister Groeneveld. The game which has been created with this engine is Minions vs Zombies.

## How did the idea come together?

We started with games we all know and after a while Plants vs Zombies came up. But the game had to have an element which isn't in present
in the original game. This element became the Minions from the movie "Despicable Me".

We hope you'll enjoy the game as much as we do!

## Gameplay

The world is being run over by zombies and only the minion army can stop them. Shooterminion, flowerminion, and bananaminion are working together to stop the zombies.

Destroy them before they take over the world!
